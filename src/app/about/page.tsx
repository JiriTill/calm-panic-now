      <p>
        Calm Panic Now is a tiny, independent project providing two quick tools that many
        people find helpful during anxious moments: <a href="/calm/box-breathing">box breathing</a> and
        the <a href="/calm/grounding-54321">5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise</a>. No sign-up, works offline.
