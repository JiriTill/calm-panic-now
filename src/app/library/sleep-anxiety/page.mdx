# Anxiety at night: how to switch off and sleep

**What to expect:** A simple wind-down routine plus a quick breathing exercise to lower arousal before bed.

## 20-minute wind-down
1. Dim lights, put your phone face-down or on Do Not Disturb.
2. Do **[Box Breathing](/calm/box-breathing)** for 2 minutes.
3. Write one line: *“One small thing I can do tomorrow is …”*

## If you wake up anxious
- Sit up, feet to the floor, slow breath out.  
- Do **[5-4-3-2-1](/calm/grounding-54321)** silently.  
- If thoughts race, repeat the exhale a bit longer than the inhale.
