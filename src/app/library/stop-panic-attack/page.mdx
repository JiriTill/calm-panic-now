# How to stop a panic attack (3 steps that work)

**TL;DR**
- Slow your breath (try [Box Breathing](/calm/box-breathing))
- Ground your senses ([5‑4‑3‑2‑1](/calm/grounding-54321))

## Quick plan (2–5 minutes)
1. Open [Box Breathing](/calm/box-breathing) for two minutes.
2. Do [5‑4‑3‑2‑1 grounding](/calm/grounding-54321).
3. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek professional support.
